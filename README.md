# How we'll handle Linting
- Install `flake8` package
- Run it through Docker compose
- When there's no output it's because there are no issues to fix
- When there are errors, fix from the bottom up, since lines might change

# Testing
- Use Django test suite
- Setup tests per Django app
- Run tests through Docker Compose
